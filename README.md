# Lazaret

A GTK desktop front-end for the ClamAV that is already installed on your system. Lazaret scans files and folders through clamd, or with `clamscan` when clamd isn't running. It moves detections into a quarantine, raises alerts when the ClamAV services in the background find something, and schedules scans with systemd timers. It doesn't bundle a virus scanner of its own.

Lazaret is a hard fork of [ClamUI](https://github.com/linx-systems/clamui).

The sidebar groups the pages the way a detection travels, and each entry shows its own status:

- **Signatures**: Signature Sources, Database Updates.
- **Scans**: Manual Scan, Scan Engine, On-Access Scanning, Scheduled Scans, Removable Drives.
- **Findings**: Detections, Quarantine, Trusted Detections, Sent Samples.

Recordings of every page are in [usage](https://codeberg.org/wvhulle/lazaret/src/branch/main/docs/usage.md).

- *(storage)* keep data in the lazaret folder for every build
- *(devshell)* give the dev build gtk's schemas so the file chooser doesn't abort
- *(errors)* show load failures in their own row and log every storage failure to the journal
- *(engine-settings)* show read-only yes/no settings as switches

# Install on NixOS

## Requirements

- NixOS with flakes enabled
- A graphical session with systemd user services

## Install ClamAV

Lazaret uses the ClamAV of your system. Turn on the daemon and signature updates, and on-access scanning if you want files blocked when they are opened:

```nix
services.clamav = {
  daemon.enable = true;
  updater.enable = true;
  clamonacc.enable = true;
};
```

## Install Lazaret

Add the flake as an input and import one of its modules:

```nix
{
  inputs.lazaret.url = "git+https://codeberg.org/wvhulle/lazaret";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, lazaret, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        lazaret.nixosModules.default
        { services.lazaret.enable = true; }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

The flake uses the binary cache `wvhulle.cachix.org`. Accept its settings when Nix asks, or Nix builds Lazaret locally.

Choose one module:

- `lazaret.nixosModules.default` installs Lazaret for every user and is required for live tuning and system-wide key files.
- `lazaret.homeManagerModules.default` installs it for one user, from your Home Manager configuration. It also accepts `services.lazaret.settings`, which fixes preferences from your configuration:

  ```nix
  services.lazaret = {
    enable = true;
    settings = {
      close-action = "minimize";
      notifications-enabled = true;
    };
  };
  ```

  The module compiles these values, and the key files from `apiKeyFiles`, into a read-only dconf database in the Nix store and locks them. Lazaret starts through a wrapper that adds this database in front of your system's dconf layers, so the app shows these settings as set in your configuration and doesn't let you change them there. Nothing is written to your own dconf database.

Enable Lazaret in only one of them.

## Background alerts

`services.lazaret.enable` starts `lazaret --background` with your graphical session, so detections by clamd and on-access scanning raise a notification even when the window is closed. Check it with:

```sh
systemctl --user status lazaret.service
```

## Live tuning

Live tuning lets you change chosen clamd settings from the app. It is on whenever `services.lazaret.enable` and `services.clamav.daemon.enable` are both set, and by default allows the six switches on the Detection page. Each change shows what will happen and asks for an administrator password, and a change that leaves clamd unable to start is rolled back.

```nix
services.lazaret.liveTuning = {
  allowedSettings = [ "DetectPUA" "OnAccessMaxFileSize" "MaxThreads" ];
  reductionLifetime = 3600;
};
```

`allowedSettings` only accepts settings whose value type Lazaret knows, so settings that run commands or change identity, such as `VirusEvent` or `User`, fail evaluation. Changes are stored in `/var/lib/lazaret/live-overrides.toml`, outside your Nix files. A change that reduces protection, such as turning off PUA detection, ends on its own after `reductionLifetime` seconds (one day by default). The settings page shows a snippet of the permanent changes to copy into your configuration, and a button to go back to the system configuration.

Set `services.lazaret.liveTuning.enable = false` to keep clamd fully declarative.

## API keys for reputation lookups

Without configuration, keys you paste under **Submissions → Services & Keys** are kept in your keyring. To manage them as secrets instead, point Lazaret at files from agenix or sops-nix. Only the path ends up in the Nix store, and the file has to be readable by your user:

```nix
age.secrets.abuse-ch-key.owner = "alice";
services.lazaret.apiKeyFiles.abuseCh = config.age.secrets.abuse-ch-key.path;
services.lazaret.apiKeyFiles.virustotal = config.age.secrets.virustotal-key.path;
```

When a path is set, Lazaret reads that file and hides the paste field.

## Update

```sh
nix flake update lazaret
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

## Uninstall

Remove the module and `services.lazaret`, and switch. Your quarantine stays in `~/.local/share/lazaret` until you delete it.
